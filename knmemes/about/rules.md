# KN Network Rules
The Kepu Nokwi network has few rules, intended to allow a full range of memes.

1. Don't get offended by things.
2. Remember this is for memes.
3. Don't directly insult another potential viewer in CHAT. This means you can insult them all you want in a MEME.
4. Unless stolen (see "[Tricks](#Tricks)" below), memes can only be reposted by their original poster.

## Tricks
Yes, you can pull a few Tricks on other people and other memes. You can:

1. Steal memes by using a "Notice of Meme Acquisition" or "I'm just stealing the meme above"
2. Cancel stealing memes with a "No u"
3. Cancel a "No u" with a "No u squared"
4. Cancel a... you know where this is going
5. Set someone virtually on fire
6. Cancel being set on fire with "No u"
7. You know where this is going

You **cannot** use a "No u infinity" or any other thing like that, that's just cheating. Also, you can't use an OC meme to steal another meme, or the shame may burn your-- you know I don't curse. --purse. Satchel! Whatever. `You'll be burning in shame.`
