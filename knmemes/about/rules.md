# KN Network Rules
The Kepu Nokwi network has few rules, intended to allow a full range of memes.

1. Don't get offended by things.
2. Remember this is for memes. Text is allowed in most rooms.
3. Don't directly insult another potential viewer in CHAT. This means you can insult them all you want in a MEME.
4. Unless stolen (see "[Tricks](#Tricks)" below), memes can only be reposted by their original poster.
5. OC memes posted here must not be posted outside of the KN Network until they expire.
6. Memes can only be posted outside by their original poster in the Kepu Nokwi network.

## Tricks
Yes, you can pull a few Tricks on other people and other memes. You can:

1. Steal memes by using a "Notice of Meme Acquisition" or "I'm just stealing the meme above"
2. Cancel stealing memes with a "No u"
3. Cancel a "No u" with a "No u squared"
4. Cancel a... you know where this is going
5. Set someone virtually on fire
6. Cancel being set on fire with "No u"
7. You know where this is going

You **cannot** use a "No u infinity" or any other thing like that, that's just cheating. Also, you can't use an OC meme to steal another meme, or the shame may burn your-- you know I don't curse. --purse. Satchel! Whatever. `You'll be burning in shame.`

## Rights
Certain Rights are provided to you on the Kepu Nokwi Network. These are, as stated:

* You may post any meme of yours or from non-KN areas of the Internet.
* You may create a derivative work from any meme, but it must not be posted outside until one month after.
* You may remove yourself from any situation that makes you feel uncomfortable.
* You are protected from Rights Violations upon your works.

### Memes Have Rights Too
* Memes may not be reposted (crossposting from/to outside of KN is the exception).
* Memes may be of any nature; these can be dark, satirical, evil, or just pure mean, as well as wholesome, themed, misthemed, etc. Your meme cannot be shamed by its nature, only ignored or praised.
* Memes may not be exploited by any member for any purpose. Declarative memes (i.e. this meme can be exploited) are **not** exempt from this!
* Memes may only be reused (not reposted or derived) by their owner.
  - Anyone else can derive any meme into another meme.
