# Star Pieces
Different variants of Stars and Star Pieces exist in the realm of Kepu Nokwi. They are used to place a value on memes, like "Likes" and "Upvotes".
When in doubt, you have the lesser amount.

## Imaginary Star
Imaginary Stars can be generated from any meme to rate it. Every original meme is worth 5 Imaginary Stars. All unused Imaginary Stars vanish once the meme they are generated from disappears.

Imaginary Stars are worth 5 Imaginary Star Pieces each. Each Imaginary Star Piece is worth one Internet Service Provider and one Golden Stardust vial.

## Golden Stardust
This is a universal Star Piece conversion format. Each Star must be declared broken down into Star Pieces then into Golden Stardust, and Golden Stardust is measured in vials.

## Fieri Star
Any memes about food can be redeemed by their creator for an amount of Fieri Stars determined by the community based on meme quality. An example amount to use as a basis for the decision is 10.

5 Fieri Stars can be converted at a time, together worth 10 Golden Stardust. Fieri Star Pieces do not exist because if they did, they would crumble into pieces. I mean, me too, thanks.

## Detri Star
Detri Stars are acquired from bad memes and is one of the two Stars that can be forged into the Neutra Star. If these are cast to a meme, the meme must be of a lower quality.
Therefore, Detri Stars are equivalent to downvotes or dislikes. These are not to be used on basis of personal opinion.

Detri Stars can be broken down into 2 Detri Star Pieces each, which per piece can be turned into 2 Golden Stardust vials.

## Incri Star
Incri Stars are aquired from high-quality, original memes and is the other Star that can be forged into the Neutra Star. If these are cast to a meme, the meme must be of a higher quality.
Therefore, Incri Stars are equivalent to upvotes or likes. These are not to be used on basis of personal opinion or to denote "views".

Incri Stars can be broken down into 2 Incri Star Pieces each, which per piece can be turned into 2 Golden Stardust vials.

## Premi Star and Sudo Star
Premi Stars are equivalent to Incri Stars, however they must be used on basis of personal opinion. Similarly, Sudo Stars are equivalent to Detri Stars, but must be used based on opinion. Neither star can be used to make a Neutra Star.

These stars can be broken down into 2 Star Pieces each, which per piece can be turned into 2 Golden Stardust vials.

## Neutra Star
Neutra Stars can be constructed by declaring the fusion of one Detri Star and one Incri Star, or by declaring a batch operation. They can be repurposed for practically anything.

## Silver Star
These really have no set purpose. Silver Stars can be made using 10 Golden Stardust vials. They can be (re)purposed for anything.

## Gold Star
Due to their rarity, they are only given to the highest quality memes on the Network. They can only be obtained by constructing them from 100 Golden Stardust vials.

## Cobalt Star
One may be passed from person to person. It's for the one with the best memes. It can be stolen back into the community from a stingy holder.
