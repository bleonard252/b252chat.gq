# What is this "Markdown"?
Markdown is a formatting style used across Reddit, GitHub, Discord, and many other platforms with various adaptions. A document looks like this:
```markdown
# What is this "Markdown"?
Yada yada yada, that text goes here.

Yede yede yede, or something like that.

## Smaller header
- List item
- List item
- List item

## Another header
1. List item
2. List item
3. List item
```

## Markdown general formatting
Generally, you can use the hash sign to indicate a header. I've also been told putting three hyphens on the next line works too:
```md
Example header
---
```

Putting different amounts of asterisks can mean bold, italics, and sometimes underlines. Feel free to test it out in the chat.

To link things, use `[text](url)`. (You can format the text and even use images!) 
**Most importantly,** to embed an image, prefix the link format with an exclamation point, like `![hover text](url)`.
