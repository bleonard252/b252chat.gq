# Shiny Pokemon Club
Welcome to the gang, kid! This is a controlled-entry Discord server (that means I'll close down entrances often), so don't count on a public link.

## What *is* the Shiny Pokemon Club?
The Shiny Pokemon Club is a group of Shiny Pokemon hunters, seeking out pictures of Shinies to go on our [Wall](wall.md). The Shiny Pokemon Club is a meme server. The Shiny Pokemon Club is a group of people, playing games, socializing, making friends. Finally, the Shiny Pokemon Club is the home of [cancer](/litteral/).

## Is this replacing Kepu Nokwi?
Kepu Nokwi needs no replacement. But if you're concerned, you can go to Family-Friendly Kepu Nokwi or #me_irl-and-not on Shiny Pokemon Club.
