# Cancer-Bot
Cancer-Bot is a Discord bot which was originally made for an ultimately short-lived server one of my friends made. It was tested on Blakini Live and deployed on the [Shiny Pokemon Club](/spc).

## Features
It has most features from Chalda's discord-bot, and:
* Temporary channels
  * `+create`: creates a text channel beginning with `tmp`
  * `+voice`: creates a voice channel beginning with `tmp`
  * `+delete`: deletes a temporary text channel you're in and you "own"
  * `+topic`: changes the topic of a temporary channel
  * `+pub`: make a temp channel public (text channels default to private)
  * `+priv`: make a temp channel private (voice channels default to public)
* `+rip ...`: Rest something in peace. Or resurrect them in pepperoni. Or reset them in pie. You get the point.
* `+features`: This area, in the chat where everyone can see! (Reduced version & link to this page.)
